# Week One Recap: My Journey to Becoming a Web Developer @ TRYBE-X Bootcamp

Here’s a summary of what I learned in the first week:

# Day 1: Introduction to the Internet

- The Internet is a massive network connecting billions of users globally.
- It's more than just buying data; it’s a network of networks.
- Routers and packet switches facilitate the flow of data.
- Governed by protocols like TCP, HTTP, and DNS.
- Networks include intranets (private) and extranets (shared).
- URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) guide browsers to resources. They come in two types:
  - Absolute URLs include all details.
  - Relative URLs are missing elements like scheme or domain.

# Day 2: Introduction to Web Technologies

- The web connects complex systems; computers on the Internet function as clients and servers.
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) structures web pages and content.

- Key HTML concepts:
  - Tags: opening and closing.
  - Content: text between tags.
  - Elements: combinations of tags and content.

The first week provided a solid foundation in web development basics. If you're interested in web development, I encourage you to follow @trybe_x on X

 I look forward to learning more in the coming weeks. Thank you, @Trybe_x for this opportunity
